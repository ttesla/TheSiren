# The Siren
A game based on SDL 1.2 which is developed a decade ago. Probably when you are reading this, it would be a lot older. I uploaded it to make it an archive. I trust github, hopefully it will save these ancient codes better and longer than I do. 

Its a CodeBlocks project but it won't be problem to build it on other IDE's. It requires SDL 1.2 headers and library files. 
The source is GP2X compatible. You can compile it if you have the GP2X [build chain](https://dl.openhandhelds.org/cgi-bin/gp2x.cgi?0,0,0,2,14).
